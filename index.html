                                in my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Some of my hobbies include playing games, 
                                listening to music, binging shows and watching boxing. My interests in IT stem from the genuine enjoyment and 
                                satisfaction I get from using computers and other pieces of technology. I have always been fascinated since I 
                                was a child, but that interest coupled with my relative skill in the department led me to pursue it further. My 
                                IT experience so far comprises of my high school subject which I completed, and any of my personal experience in 
                                day to day use.

                                  I have had an interest in computers ever since I was a child therefore it resulted in me taking up this 
                                  course to complete, many of my interests for IT also come from my hobbies at home which includes figuring out 
                                  how to build systems at home and also looking at the differences in hardware in computer systems. My hobbies 
                                  include playing games, listening to music and looking after my pets at home. Aside from my interest in IT at 
                                  home, I have done IT in High School for 2 years and that’s where I have my current experience from and just 
                                  general knowledge from at home. Test Results: Myers Briggs Test: INFJ-T / Advocate Learning Style Test: Visual 
                                  Psychometric Test:  Confidence 6/10, Achievement Driven 7/10. Overall, these tests show that I am more of a 
                                  visual learner and work best with examples shown to me visually. I will attempt to complete the work given to 
                                  me but may have troubles understanding my work if not explained visually, due to this burden, I will attempt to 
                                  make it as clear as I can when I do not understand something and hopefully these test results show my team members what kind of learning style I have. Ideal Job: Network and/or Systems Engineer

                                moving; I best learn "hands-on" and I've always preferred to touch, move, build, or draw what I learn, and I 
                                tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. I like to take things apart and put 
                                things together and I tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when I become bored. As a tactile learner,
                                I am more of a practical worker, but also tend to do things in bursts and haphazardly - get a lot of work 
                                done at once, then take a break for a while. 
                                Generally I prefer to let someone else take charge - I like to be responsible for only one particular part 
                                of a project. That way, I know that the work I have done is quality or not and who else has done what. This 
                                also carries across when I do group work.

                                I love going to see live music and hanging out with friends and family. 
                                My interest in IT started through my love for technology, and how I was able to understand new tech easily. 
                                I unfortunately don’t have any experience in IT, but I hope to gain that knowledge and skills through 
                                completing the Bachelor of Information Technology. My MBTI test results were ISTP-T meaning I focus on facts 
                                and details; I am a logical thinker and decision maker and I can be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned 
                                and organized. My learning style is auditory meaning I prefer to learn through having a concept explained to me, 
                                rather than having to read the concept by myself. My Psycho-Metric test results show that I possess assertiveness, 
                                cooperation, openness and patience skills. These results show me that I can adapt to any position in a team, and
                                I am able to be open and patient with members in the team. I can consider the details of the project and can be 
                                flexible with ideas. I think this can be useful as it will help my team connect our ideas and creativity to the 
                                criteria of the project. My ideal Job is to be a Senior Web Designer.

                                my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My Hobbies include but are not limited to, playing games, art and 
                                socialising with friends. My personal interest in IT include things such as programming and as of recently, web 
                                programming. My experience in IT is rather new as I have only just started my IT course, but I have in the past 
                                built my personal computer and learnt the basics of C#. In the Myer-Briggs personality type test I got ESFP-T, 
                                the entertainer , being more extroverted in nature will benefit the group greatly as I have the ability to relate 
                                to others and think on my feet, resulting in being a resourceful and inspiring group member. From the “Big 5 
                                Personality test” I scored a 78% in extraversion which further reinforces the results from the Myer-Briggs 
                                personality type test. Finally, I am an auditory learner which means I can benefit the team as I am able to pick 
                                up more auditory information and understand what needs to be done.
                                My ideal job is an application Programmer

                                born and raised in South Africa. Currently doing my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies include exercising.
                                I make it part of my daily routine. I also  enjoy baking and DIY projects. As a young entrepreneur and business owner my interest and passion for IT stemmed 
                                from doing my own online marketing   and assisted web designs for my own businesses. I have no official IT 
                                experience to date. I plan to obtain experience whilst completing my Bachelor of Information Technology degree. 
                                I am known to be a perfectionist, but I feel it is a good reflection of my attention to detail. In the Myer-Briggs 
                                personality type test I got INTJ. The results of the three tests reassure me that I am a well-organized and detailed 
                                individual. My learning style is visual. I respond better to information presented in a visual format. Creativity is 
                                my release and I would like to explore this more through my career path. I take my career very seriously and will 
                                do my best to complete any task given to me. The results will be helpful to my group as they will be more aware of 
                                where my strengths and weaknesses are and can therefore balance them out with the other team members' results. My ideal 
                                Job would be a Product Manager.

                      <h2>IT Work</h2>
                       <h3>Donovan Humphries: CTO at DomaCom</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                          1.      What kind of work is done by the IT professional?<br>
                          I do three main things which include software development (coding), IT infrastructure management and support so if DomaCom has any IT related issues I solve them from small things like fixing a mouse to implementing a CMS (content management system).
                          <br>2.      How big is your team?<br>
                          My team consists of 6 people.
                          <br>3.      How long have you been in the industry? 15 years full time<br>
                          I have been in the industry for 15 years full time and 5 years part time gaining my experience when I started.
                          <br>4.      What qualifications do you have?<br>
                          Bachelor of Computer Science, 
                          Master of Business Administration (MBA)
                          <br>5.      What was your first job in the industry?<br>
                          I started out in the industry as a Web developer.
                          <br>6.      What kinds of people do you interact with? other IT professionals? clients? investors? the general public?
                          <br>I interact with the other IT people within my team. Business individuals who are in sales, marketing and client services team. I will only interact with a client where there are partnerships involved. I deal with the B2B (business to business) rather than to individual customers.
                          <br>7.      What do you find you spend most of your time on?
                          <br>I spend most of my time doing product management and development.
                          <br>8.      What aspect of their position is most challenging?
                          <br>Dealing with people who have low IT literacy. This restricts me as I need to keep things simple to avoid confusion. When you are dealing with someone who has low IT literacy it is hard to be on the same page at limits how technical I can be.
                          <br>9.      What do you like most about your work?
                          <br>Ability to be creative and solve problems.
                          <br>10.   What is the best career decision you have ever made?
                          <br>The current position I am was the best career decision I have made. I had to take a step down in terms of my position, but it was an interesting organisation and I saw potential and growth possibilities within DomaCom.
                          <br>11.   How would you describe the IT industry culture?
                          <br>The IT industry is still very male dominated. The industry is introspective, fun, exciting, current and ever changing. It is where all the cool stuff is happening.
                          <br>12.   Do you think there are opportunities for self-employment within the IT industry?
                          <br>Absolutely yes through contract work. The industry is built on start-ups. The start up costs are low in comparison to other industries. Your knowledge is your main component.
                          <br>13.   Is the field growing fast enough so that there is room for graduates like ourselves in industry?
                          <br>No, I don’t think it is growing fast enough. It is hard to get a job in Australia in comparison to the UK where I worked previously. Employees are looking for skills and graduates tend to not have them due to lack of experience and therefore struggle to find jobs.
                          <br>14.   Any advice on how to write a resume that will appeal to employers in the IT industry?
                          <br>Focus on your practical experience instead of buzz words. The facts count not how you word it.
                          <br>15.   How can we as students assess whether we have the skills needed for a position such as yours?
                          <br>Technical as well as people skills are important. I suggest doing an internship as it will give you a good idea on what to expect in the industry and if you are able to complete what is expected of you. If you are running a team and have lack of skills or knowledge, they won’t take you seriously.
                          <br>16.   Have you done the Meyers-Briggs assessment? If yes what were your results and is it a good reflection of the type of person you are?
                          <br>Yes, INTJ. I believe that this test does not represent who you will be under pressure. I can however identify with a few of the points. I also learnt a few things about myself that I was not aware of before such as being an introvert.
                          <br>17.   What hours do you work? Is there flexibility in your hours?

                        <h2>Project: Biometric ATMs</h2>
                            <p>The project plan is to create biometric thumbprint scanners for ATMs, to give customers cardless access to their bank accounts. 
                            This would supplement the current method of customers using cards and PIN codes to access their accounts, so as to give customers the option between 
                            using card or biometric and also in case the biometric method fails. 
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>A thumbprint is always more secure than a card or a pin and entirely unique to a single person, making it 
                            impossible to cheat. Even today, with card lock and similar abilities that banks give 
                            customers, a thumbprint is far harder to forge or steal. Scanning a thumbprint is also faster than having 
                            to insert a card or type out a PIN. In today's day and age, biometric security is becoming more and more ubiquitous. Iris, facial and 
                            thumbprint recognition are all commonplace in the commercial world as part of banks, airport security etc. 
                            Smartphones and laptops have used thumbprint and facial recognition software for many years now. It seems 
                            logical that something as widely used as ATMs should have biometric security, at least alongside current 
                            security.
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>The project will require software and hardware changes to current ATMs. Adding thumbprint scanners will be 
                            required. To set up, customers can use their banking app, or go to a bank branch in person to set up any number of thumbprints they like that 
                            can access to their account on an ATM. This thumbprint is stored in the bank's database. If they already 
                            have a thumbprint set up, they have the option of enabling or disabling access by thumbprint for ATMs. 
                            They won't have the option of disabling access by card - this should be a fallback in case they are unable to use an ATM with their fingerprint. 
                            As for the physical scanners themselves, these are available off-the-shelf commercially for individuals and companies alike.
                            If needed, scanners can be built for the ATMs.  The scanners should be built into existing ATMs,
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>Extra code may have to be written for the ATMs to be able to use the thumbprint scanners. However, due to how commonplace 
                            these scanners are, it may be possible to implement existing software so as to reduce the work and cost needed.
                            The implementation process will involve construction and programmers alike, though the skills should not be too hard to find.
                            Again, due to how common biometric security is, it will surely be easy to find programmers to program the scanners 
                            to work with ATMs. It may be more difficult inserting the scanners into the ATMs themselves  
                            <br><br>
                            The perfect outcome and ultimate goal would be to reduce the average use time of ATMs and improve customer satisfaction.
                            People don't like to take too long just to withdraw cash at an ATM and they like waiting in line to use one even 
                            less.

                        <br>Loretta Corby was highly enthusiastic and was always ready to do what needed to be done. She helped lighten the mood of meetings, providing plenty of support on top of her workload. She wrote plenty about our project ideas and IT Technologies. She also had many useful insights about how to improve the content of our project, pointing out better ways to convey information and what else to add.

                        <br>High5 worked well as a team. We all completed tasks delegated to us within the given time frames. We reached consensus on all group decisions with no big issues or disagreements. This was most surprising to me due to bad experiences with teamwork in past studies. The team had no conflict or disagreements that needed to be addressed in order to resolve. It took us a bit longer to select a project idea as we wanted to select something achievable for assignment three. We eventually came to an agreement and unanimously decided on a project idea. Everyone attended scheduled meetings and gave their input. Our meetings were regular and to the point for us to easily keep track of who was responsible for which task and, to monitor our teams progress. We are a well-balanced team with different personalities that worked well together. The tasks allocated to the team members were based on their interests and strengths. Work was evenly distributed between the team members and we communicated regularly regarding work that needed to be done, work completed as well as any push or pull actions carried out to avoid conflict. As a group we could improve by looking at the feedback of this assignment and identify where our weaknesses are as a group and address them in assignment three. I have learnt that it is possible to be in a group where all team members pull their weight and have an equal contribution to the assignment.

                        <br>HIGH5 was a great group to be a part of for this assignment. From the start, we all got along great and were able to bounce off ideas in our first group meeting. It was great to be a part of a group that was made of such diverse personalities, as it made the process of coming to decisions more encompassing, as every possible solution was considered. Everyone attended every group meeting and contributed a great deal to them. I thought the way in which we decided on the project idea was great, as we all provided our previous assignment’s idea and were able to choose the best idea that suited us as a group, and the one we thought was the best for taking through to assignment 3. It was great to see everyone putting in their best efforts and working hard to get assigned tasks done by the agreed date. I look forward to continue working on the following assignments with this group.

                        <br>What I believe went well was how excellently we all worked together as a group, everyone pulled their own weight and got things done to an above satisfactory level of work, everyone in the group made themselves available for group meetings and participated in discussion outside the meetings to get work done and keep active communications between the group. I cannot think of anything that needs to be approved upon as I wholeheartedly believe we all did a great job in this assignment. One thing that surprised me was how well we all worked together and how everyone did as they were expected and requested of, we were two groups merged and the group chemistry is considerably great considering the circumstances of the merging. One thing I learned about groups is that when many amazing individuals with dedicated mindsets come together to work towards a certain goal, they are able to accomplish many great things, this experience has really opened my mind up to working in groups and what great can come from it and I thoroughly look forward to working with everyone again in future assignments

                        <br>Our group (High5) was an excellent group to be apart of during this assignment, we cooperated amazingly and got the work done in time and provided a lot of help for each other. Every member was excellent in the way they operated and done their tasks and each person had their own work to manage and they did. Our interviews and the way we discussed our work showed how well our team worked together and made sure we got all the work done whilst making sure no one was facing any problems and if they were, how to correct and help the people who had confusion within the topics. All of this shows how great the team worked together as we finished the work with a satisfactory level and helped each other when needed. Due to my lack of knowledge is some areas, it was good to see how others approached the situations which helped me a lot in seeing how I should also approach a certain situation. Overall, I am looking forward to working with this group again for future assignments and hopefully I can be more knowledgeable in our work making sure I provide more help when needed.

                        <br>Our Group worked fantastically throughout the course of the entire assignment. Despite coming together somewhat inorganically, we quickly became very co-operative, which became seminal to the final outcome. Every single group member completed a sufficient amount of work, with most even going further in order to maximise the success of the assignment. Our bi-weekly meetings were always clearly scheduled, and each one had all members present and discussing ideas in order to efficiently designate and complete tasks. Throughout the time we were together, we had very strong communications, with no member being out of reach, meaning any requests or inquiries we had were quickly met with valuable feedback. Our consistent organization meant that each member had a set amount of work to do by a set date, meaning our progress was never hindered by missing pieces of information, furthering the momentum we had built as a team. I genuinely lack any sort of criticisms for the way we worked together to complete this assignment, and it has taught me a lesson about the importance of communication and consistency in a group environment. I look forward to working with High5 again in the upcoming assignments.

                        <br>The way High 5 came together was a last minute amalgamation of several people. Yet, High 5 has been nothing less than a privilege to be a part of. Despite coming from different backgrounds, with different levels of skill and interests, the members of High 5 had cohesion I’ve rarely found in group projects. Every member was hardworking, clever, friendly, uncomplaining and brought something unique to the table, whether prior experience, useful editing knowledge or even just a few good laughs. Oftentimes, the project felt less like a task to be done and more truly like something done just for fun and passion for IT. When I, or anyone else ran into a problem, we didn’t even need to ask for help - someone would step in and pick up the slack or show us how to do it. Communication was constant and everyone always was easy to talk to and replied with what they’d achieved. Yet, it never felt bothersome because the group was able to bond over jokes and humorous interjections during meetings and chats. During downtime we would often talk about anything; our lives, our subjects and our interests - which always came back to IT. I certainly look forward to working with High 5 again.
