                                <p>My name is Adem Doger, I’m 18 years old and was born in Australia with a Turkish background. I’m currently enrolled 
                                in my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Some of my hobbies include playing games, 
                                listening to music, binging shows and watching boxing. My interests in IT stem from the genuine enjoyment and 
                                satisfaction I get from using computers and other pieces of technology. I have always been fascinated since I 
                                was a child, but that interest coupled with my relative skill in the department led me to pursue it further. My 
                                IT experience so far comprises of my high school subject which I completed, and any of my personal experience in 
                                day to day use.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  My name is Adem Coskun, I’m 18 years old with a Turkish background and have started my first year for Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. 
                                  I have had an interest in computers ever since I was a child therefore it resulted in me taking up this 
                                  course to complete, many of my interests for IT also come from my hobbies at home which includes figuring out 
                                  how to build systems at home and also looking at the differences in hardware in computer systems. My hobbies 
                                  include playing games, listening to music and looking after my pets at home. Aside from my interest in IT at 
                                  home, I have done IT in High School for 2 years and that’s where I have my current experience from and just 
                                  general knowledge from at home. Test Results: Myers Briggs Test: INFJ-T / Advocate Learning Style Test: Visual 
                                  Psychometric Test:  Confidence 6/10, Achievement Driven 7/10. Overall, these tests show that I am more of a 
                                  visual learner and work best with examples shown to me visually. I will attempt to complete the work given to 
                                  me but may have troubles understanding my work if not explained visually, due to this burden, I will attempt to 
                                  make it as clear as I can when I do not understand something and hopefully these test results show my team members what kind of learning style I have. Ideal Job: Network and/or Systems Engineer

                                <p>I am a tactile learner; I learn by touching and doing. I best understand and remember things through physically 
                                moving; I best learn "hands-on" and I've always preferred to touch, move, build, or draw what I learn, and I 
                                tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. I like to take things apart and put 
                                things together and I tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when I become bored. As a tactile learner,
                                I am more of a practical worker, but also tend to do things in bursts and haphazardly - get a lot of work 
                                done at once, then take a break for a while. 
                                Generally I prefer to let someone else take charge - I like to be responsible for only one particular part 
                                of a project. That way, I know that the work I have done is quality or not and who else has done what. This 
                                also carries across when I do group work.
                                </p>
                            <h3>Loretta Corby </h3> 
                                <p>Hi! I’m Loretta Corby, I’m from Melbourne and have lived just north of the city my whole life. 
                                I love going to see live music and hanging out with friends and family. 
                                My interest in IT started through my love for technology, and how I was able to understand new tech easily. 
                                I unfortunately don’t have any experience in IT, but I hope to gain that knowledge and skills through 
                                completing the Bachelor of Information Technology. My MBTI test results were ISTP-T meaning I focus on facts 
                                and details; I am a logical thinker and decision maker and I can be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned 
                                and organized. My learning style is auditory meaning I prefer to learn through having a concept explained to me, 
                                rather than having to read the concept by myself. My Psycho-Metric test results show that I possess assertiveness, 
                                cooperation, openness and patience skills. These results show me that I can adapt to any position in a team, and
                                I am able to be open and patient with members in the team. I can consider the details of the project and can be 
                                flexible with ideas. I think this can be useful as it will help my team connect our ideas and creativity to the 
                                criteria of the project. My ideal Job is to be a Senior Web Designer.

                                <p>My name is Katelyn Knight, I'm eighteen years old, I was born and raised in Australia and I am currently studying 
                                my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My Hobbies include but are not limited to, playing games, art and 
                                socialising with friends. My personal interest in IT include things such as programming and as of recently, web 
                                programming. My experience in IT is rather new as I have only just started my IT course, but I have in the past 
                                built my personal computer and learnt the basics of C#. In the Myer-Briggs personality type test I got ESFP-T, 
                                the entertainer , being more extroverted in nature will benefit the group greatly as I have the ability to relate 
                                to others and think on my feet, resulting in being a resourceful and inspiring group member. From the “Big 5 
                                Personality test” I scored a 78% in extraversion which further reinforces the results from the Myer-Briggs 
                                personality type test. Finally, I am an auditory learner which means I can benefit the team as I am able to pick 
                                up more auditory information and understand what needs to be done.

                                <p>
                                My name is Chinae Roxanne Humphries, I am 28 years old, born and raised in South Africa. Currently doing my Bachelor 
                                of Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies include exercising. I make it part of my daily routine. I also 
                                enjoy baking and DIY projects. As a young entrepreneur and business owner my interest and passion for IT stemmed 
                                from doing my own online marketing and assisted web designs for my own businesses. I have no official IT 
                                experience to date. I plan to obtain experience whilst completing my Bachelor of Information Technology degree. 
                                I am known to be a perfectionist, but I feel it is a good reflection of my attention to detail. In the Myer-Briggs 
                                personality type test I got INTJ. The results of the three tests reassure me that I am a well-organized and detailed 
                                individual. My learning style is visual. I respond better to information presented in a visual format. Creativity is 
                                my release and I would like to explore this more through my career path. I take my career very seriously and will 
                                do my best to complete any task given to me. The results will be helpful to my group as they will be more aware of 
                                where my strengths and weaknesses are and can therefore balance them out with the other team members' results. My ideal 
                                Job would be a Product Manager.

                       <h3>Donovan Humphries: CTO at DomaCom</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                          1.      What kind of work is done by the IT professional?<br>
                          I do three main things which include software development (coding), IT infrastructure management and support so if DomaCom has any IT related issues I solve them from small things like fixing a mouse to implementing a CMS (content management system).
                          <br>2.      How big is your team?<br>
                          My team consists of 6 people.
                          <br>3.      How long have you been in the industry? 15 years full time<br>
                          I have been in the industry for 15 years full time and 5 years part time gaining my experience when I started.
                          <br>4.      What qualifications do you have?<br>
                          Bachelor of Computer Science, 
                          Master of Business Administration (MBA)
                          <br>5.      What was your first job in the industry?<br>
                          I started out in the industry as a Web developer.
                          <br>6.      What kinds of people do you interact with? other IT professionals? clients? investors? the general public?
                          <br>I interact with the other IT people within my team. Business individuals who are in sales, marketing and client services team. I will only interact with a client where there are partnerships involved. I deal with the B2B (business to business) rather than to individual customers.
                          <br>7.      What do you find you spend most of your time on?
                          <br>I spend most of my time doing product management and development.
                          <br>8.      What aspect of their position is most challenging?
                          <br>Dealing with people who have low IT literacy. This restricts me as I need to keep things simple to avoid confusion. When you are dealing with someone who has low IT literacy it is hard to be on the same page at limits how technical I can be.
                          <br>9.      What do you like most about your work?
                          <br>Ability to be creative and solve problems.
                          <br>10.   What is the best career decision you have ever made?
                          <br>The current position I am was the best career decision I have made. I had to take a step down in terms of my position, but it was an interesting organisation and I saw potential and growth possibilities within DomaCom.
                          <br>11.   How would you describe the IT industry culture?
                          <br>The IT industry is still very male dominated. The industry is introspective, fun, exciting, current and ever changing. It is where all the cool stuff is happening.
                          <br>12.   Do you think there are opportunities for self-employment within the IT industry?
                          <br>Absolutely yes through contract work. The industry is built on start-ups. The start up costs are low in comparison to other industries. Your knowledge is your main component.
                          <br>13.   Is the field growing fast enough so that there is room for graduates like ourselves in industry?
                          <br>No, I don’t think it is growing fast enough. It is hard to get a job in Australia in comparison to the UK where I worked previously. Employees are looking for skills and graduates tend to not have them due to lack of experience and therefore struggle to find jobs.
                          <br>14.   Any advice on how to write a resume that will appeal to employers in the IT industry?
                          <br>Focus on your practical experience instead of buzz words. The facts count not how you word it.
                          <br>15.   How can we as students assess whether we have the skills needed for a position such as yours?
                          <br>Technical as well as people skills are important. I suggest doing an internship as it will give you a good idea on what to expect in the industry and if you are able to complete what is expected of you. If you are running a team and have lack of skills or knowledge, they won’t take you seriously.
                          <br>16.   Have you done the Meyers-Briggs assessment? If yes what were your results and is it a good reflection of the type of person you are?
                          <br>Yes, INTJ. I believe that this test does not represent who you will be under pressure. I can however identify with a few of the points. I also learnt a few things about myself that I was not aware of before such as being an introvert.
                          <br>17.   What hours do you work? Is there flexibility in your hours?
                          <br>I work 8-5 Monday to Friday, and I have flexibility in my hours due to my position.
                          <br>If extra hours need to be worked in order to deliver what was promised, then I will work extra hours. I do my best to manage my team effectively so that we do not need to work in the extra hours. Time management is important here.
                          <br>18.   What do you do if you are unable to solve a problem on your own?
                          <br>I consult my team and we brainstorm ideas on how to solve the problem.
                          <br>19.   What industry related software do you use?
                          <br>Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Azure (hosting) Microsoft.
                          <br>20.   Do you have any advice for us entering the industry?
                          <br>Build stuff it’s the best thing to show when looking for a job and building up your resume.

                        <h2>Project: Biometric ATMs</h2>
                            <p>The project plan is to create biometric thumbprint scanners for ATMs, to give customers cardless access to their bank accounts. 
                            This would supplement the current method of customers using cards and PIN codes to access their accounts, so as to give customers the option between 
                            using card or biometric and also in case the biometric method fails. 
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>A thumbprint is always more secure than a card or a pin and entirely unique to a single person, making it 
                            impossible to cheat. Even today, with card lock and similar abilities that banks give 
                            customers, a thumbprint is far harder to forge or steal. Scanning a thumbprint is also faster than having 
                            to insert a card or type out a PIN. In today's day and age, biometric security is becoming more and more ubiquitous. Iris, facial and 
                            thumbprint recognition are all commonplace in the commercial world as part of banks, airport security etc. 
                            Smartphones and laptops have used thumbprint and facial recognition software for many years now. It seems 
                            logical that something as widely used as ATMs should have biometric security, at least alongside current 
                            security.
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>The project will require software and hardware changes to current ATMs. Adding thumbprint scanners will be 
                            required. To set up, customers can use their banking app, or go to a bank branch in person to set up any number of thumbprints they like that 
                            can access to their account on an ATM. This thumbprint is stored in the bank's database. If they already 
                            have a thumbprint set up, they have the option of enabling or disabling access by thumbprint for ATMs. 
                            They won't have the option of disabling access by card - this should be a fallback in case they are unable to use an ATM with their fingerprint. 
                            As for the physical scanners themselves, these are available off-the-shelf commercially for individuals and companies alike.
                            If needed, scanners can be built for the ATMs.  The scanners should be built into existing ATMs,
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>Extra code may have to be written for the ATMs to be able to use the thumbprint scanners. However, due to how commonplace 
                            these scanners are, it may be possible to implement existing software so as to reduce the work and cost needed.
                            The implementation process will involve construction and programmers alike, though the skills should not be too hard to find.
                            Again, due to how common biometric security is, it will surely be easy to find programmers to program the scanners 
                            to work with ATMs. It may be more difficult inserting the scanners into the ATMs themselves  
                            <br><br>
                            The perfect outcome and ultimate goal would be to reduce the average use time of ATMs and improve customer satisfaction.
                            People don't like to take too long just to withdraw cash at an ATM and they like waiting in line to use one even 
                            less.
