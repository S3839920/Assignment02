                I’ve always liked using computers but my interest in the wide world of IT first came about when I was 15. 
                I studied game-making in highschool and found myself interested in the many other aspects of IT. I studied 
                IT in VCE and decided to take up Software Engineering. However I found it wasn’t what I expected and 
                decided to move to IT instead.
                <br><br>
                I chose RMIT because for someone who wanted to study IT, it seemed like a no brainer. There are more IT 
                courses to choose from than any other university and IT is literally in its name. 
                <br><br>
                I hope to get experience in all aspects of IT, enough to be able to start a career in any sector of IT like 
                networking, security, programming, database management, etc.

                A content producer creates music and audio; in this case for Apple’s computers, phones and tablets. In 
                today’s world, the music industry is almost entirely reliant on technology. <br>
                Sound/music design/production has always been a passion of mine, and being able to combine it with IT is a 
                dream - perhaps not necessarily at Apple, but still highly desirable. This job would require skill in using 
                MIDI and digital audio workstations like Logic Pro, developer knowledge of said products plus that of Macs 
                plus songwriting ability. I have used Logic Pro and MIDI before, but certainly don’t have professional 
                knowledge of the skills required. I would have to be trained specifically in Logic Pro, or another DAW if 
                at another company, in MIDI and also in using Apple products and music production.<br><div>

                I am a tactile learner; I learn by touching and doing. I best understand and remember things through physically 
                moving; I best learn "hands-on" and I've always preferred to touch, move, build, or draw what I learn, and I 
                tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. I like to take things apart and put 
                things together and I tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when I become bored. As a tactile learner,
                I am more of a practical worker, but also tend to do things in bursts and haphazardly - get a lot of work 
                done at once, then take a break for a while. 
                Generally I prefer to let someone else take charge - I like to be responsible for only one particular part 
                of a project. That way, I know that the work I have done is quality or not and who else has done what. This 
                also carries across when I do group work.

                <h2>Project: Biometric ATMs</h2>
                The project plan is to create biometric thumbprint scanners for ATMs, to give customers cardless access to their bank accounts. 
                This would supplement the current method of customers using cards and PIN codes to access their accounts, so as to give customers the option between 
                using card or biometric and also in case the biometric method fails. 
                <br><br>
                A thumbprint is always more secure than a card or a pin and entirely unique to a single person, making it 
                impossible to cheat. Even today, with card lock and similar abilities that banks give 
                customers, a thumbprint is far harder to forge or steal. Scanning a thumbprint is also faster than having 
                to insert a card or type out a PIN. In today's day and age, biometric security is becoming more and more ubiquitous. Iris, facial and 
                thumbprint recognition are all commonplace in the commercial world as part of banks, airport security etc. 
                Smartphones and laptops have used thumbprint and facial recognition software for many years now. It seems 
                logical that something as widely used as ATMs should have biometric security, at least alongside current 
                security. 
                <br><br>
                The project will require software and hardware changes to current ATMs. Adding thumbprint scanners will be 
                required. To set up, customers can use their banking app, or go to a bank branch in person to set up any number of thumbprints they like that 
                can access to their account on an ATM. This thumbprint is stored in the bank's database. If they already 
                have a thumbprint set up, they have the option of enabling or disabling access by thumbprint for ATMs. 
                They won't have the option of disabling access by card - this should be a fallback in case they are unable to use an ATM with their fingerprint. 
                As for the physical scanners themselves, these are available off-the-shelf commercially for individuals and companies alike.
                If needed, scanners can be built for the ATMs.  The scanners should be built into existing ATMs,
      
                <br><br>
                Extra code may have to be written for the ATMs to be able to use the thumbprint scanners. However, due to how commonplace 
                these scanners are, it may be possible to implement existing software so as to reduce the work and cost needed.
                The implementation process will involve construction and programmers alike, though the skills should not be too hard to find.
                Again, due to how common biometric security is, it will surely be easy to find programmers to program the scanners 
                to work with ATMs. It may be more difficult inserting the scanners into the ATMs themselves  
                <br><br>
                The perfect outcome and ultimate goal would be to reduce the average use time of ATMs and improve customer satisfaction.
                People don't like to take too long just to withdraw cash at an ATM and they like waiting in line to use one even 
                less.
