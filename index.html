                            <h3>Adem Doger</h3> 
                                <p>My name is Adem Doger, I’m 18 years old and was born in Australia with a Turkish background. I’m currently enrolled 
                                in my first year of a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Some of my hobbies include playing games, 
                                listening to music, binging shows and watching boxing. My interests in IT stem from the genuine enjoyment and 
                                satisfaction I get from using computers and other pieces of technology. I have always been fascinated since I 
                                was a child, but that interest coupled with my relative skill in the department led me to pursue it further. My 
                                IT experience so far comprises of my high school subject which I completed, and any of my personal experience in 
                                day to day use.
                                </p>
                            <h3>Darren Geary</h3>
                                <p>I am a tactile learner; I learn by touching and doing. I best understand and remember things through physically 
                                moving; I best learn "hands-on" and I've always preferred to touch, move, build, or draw what I learn, and I 
                                tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. I like to take things apart and put 
                                things together and I tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when I become bored. As a tactile learner,
                                I am more of a practical worker, but also tend to do things in bursts and haphazardly - get a lot of work 
                                done at once, then take a break for a while. 
                                Generally I prefer to let someone else take charge - I like to be responsible for only one particular part 
                                of a project. That way, I know that the work I have done is quality or not and who else has done what. This 
                                also carries across when I do group work.
                                </p>
                            <h3>Loretta Corby </h3> 
                                <p>Hi! I’m Loretta Corby, I’m from Melbourne and have lived just north of the city my whole life. 
                                I love going to see live music and hanging out with friends and family. 
                                My interest in IT started through my love for technology, and how I was able to understand new tech easily. 
                                I unfortunately don’t have any experience in IT, but I hope to gain that knowledge and skills through 
                                completing the Bachelor of Information Technology. My MBTI test results were ISTP-T meaning I focus on facts 
                                and details; I am a logical thinker and decision maker and I can be spontaneous and flexible rather than planned 
                                and organized. My learning style is auditory meaning I prefer to learn through having a concept explained to me, 
                                rather than having to read the concept by myself. My Psycho-Metric test results show that I possess assertiveness, 
                                cooperation, openness and patience skills. These results show me that I can adapt to any position in a team, and
                                I am able to be open and patient with members in the team. I can consider the details of the project and can be 
                                flexible with ideas. I think this can be useful as it will help my team connect our ideas and creativity to the 
                                criteria of the project. My ideal Job is to be a Senior Web Designer.

                                <p>My name is Katelyn Knight, I'm eighteen years old, I was born and raised in Australia and I am currently studying 
                                my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My Hobbies include but are not limited to, playing games, art and 
                                socialising with friends. My personal interest in IT include things such as programming and as of recently, web 
                                programming. My experience in IT is rather new as I have only just started my IT course, but I have in the past 
                                built my personal computer and learnt the basics of C#. In the Myer-Briggs personality type test I got ESFP-T, 
                                the entertainer , being more extroverted in nature will benefit the group greatly as I have the ability to relate 
                                to others and think on my feet, resulting in being a resourceful and inspiring group member. From the “Big 5 
                                Personality test” I scored a 78% in extraversion which further reinforces the results from the Myer-Briggs 
                                personality type test. Finally, I am an auditory learner which means I can benefit the team as I am able to pick 
                                up more auditory information and understand what needs to be done.

                        <h2>Project: Biometric ATMs</h2>
                            <p>The project plan is to create biometric thumbprint scanners for ATMs, to give customers cardless access to their bank accounts. 
                            This would supplement the current method of customers using cards and PIN codes to access their accounts, so as to give customers the option between 
                            using card or biometric and also in case the biometric method fails. 
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>A thumbprint is always more secure than a card or a pin and entirely unique to a single person, making it 
                            impossible to cheat. Even today, with card lock and similar abilities that banks give 
                            customers, a thumbprint is far harder to forge or steal. Scanning a thumbprint is also faster than having 
                            to insert a card or type out a PIN. In today's day and age, biometric security is becoming more and more ubiquitous. Iris, facial and 
                            thumbprint recognition are all commonplace in the commercial world as part of banks, airport security etc. 
                            Smartphones and laptops have used thumbprint and facial recognition software for many years now. It seems 
                            logical that something as widely used as ATMs should have biometric security, at least alongside current 
                            security.
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>The project will require software and hardware changes to current ATMs. Adding thumbprint scanners will be 
                            required. To set up, customers can use their banking app, or go to a bank branch in person to set up any number of thumbprints they like that 
                            can access to their account on an ATM. This thumbprint is stored in the bank's database. If they already 
                            have a thumbprint set up, they have the option of enabling or disabling access by thumbprint for ATMs. 
                            They won't have the option of disabling access by card - this should be a fallback in case they are unable to use an ATM with their fingerprint. 
                            As for the physical scanners themselves, these are available off-the-shelf commercially for individuals and companies alike.
                            If needed, scanners can be built for the ATMs.  The scanners should be built into existing ATMs,
                            </p>
                        <br><br>
                            <p>Extra code may have to be written for the ATMs to be able to use the thumbprint scanners. However, due to how commonplace 
                            these scanners are, it may be possible to implement existing software so as to reduce the work and cost needed.
                            The implementation process will involve construction and programmers alike, though the skills should not be too hard to find.
                            Again, due to how common biometric security is, it will surely be easy to find programmers to program the scanners 
                            to work with ATMs. It may be more difficult inserting the scanners into the ATMs themselves  
                            <br><br>
                            The perfect outcome and ultimate goal would be to reduce the average use time of ATMs and improve customer satisfaction.
                            People don't like to take too long just to withdraw cash at an ATM and they like waiting in line to use one even 
                            less.
